This overview guides you through building an admission prediction model using regression in a Jupyter Notebook.

Data Preparation:

Import libraries: Begin by importing necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Load data: Use pandas.read_csv() to load your dataset containing student information and their admission status (admitted/not admitted).
Explore data: Use describe(), head(), and visualizations to understand the data's characteristics, missing values, and relationships between features.
Preprocess data: Handle missing values by imputation or removal, encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding, and scale numerical features if necessary.
Split data: Separate the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split() for model evaluation.
Model Building:

Choose model: Select a suitable regression algorithm based on your data and prediction goals. Some options include:
Linear Regression: Good for understanding linear relationships between features and admission status.
Logistic Regression: Suitable for predicting binary outcomes (admitted/not admitted) even with non-linear relationships.
Decision Tree Regression: Can handle complex non-linear relationships but may be less interpretable.
Random Forest Regression: Combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy and robustness.
Create model: Instantiate the chosen model using scikit-learn's implementation.
Train model: Fit the model on the training data using model.fit().
Evaluate model: Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared for regression models and accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification models. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using model.score().
